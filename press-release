### üì± Product Overview
Mentee is an application for high-school graduates or GED holders from underprivileged communities and nontraditional backgrounds looking to build career skills through mentorship and community. Mentees can practice technical code, learn what a career in tech looks like, and receive support from mentors and Mentee friends via live communication throughout their career journey.

### üìù Summary
According to the National Center for Education Statistics, only about 38% of immigrants or first-generation Americans pursue higher education, with 30% of the initial graduating compared to 42% enrollment of their white counterparts (NCES). 

Within the industry, 97% of professionals hold an associate's Degree or higher, meaning only 3% of professionals within tech come from nontraditional backgrounds. White professionals also take up a large chunk of the industry, with 58.9% of tech professionals identifying as ‚Äúwhite‚Äù (ZIPPIA). 

Statistics clearly illustrate the disadvantage a minority person from a nontraditional background faces trying to break into the tech industry. For BIPOC, receiving a boot camp of self-taught education is not sufficient. Individuals miss out on networking opportunities and job fairs that a higher education institution provides when they are not degreed. These opportunities compound over the four-year college career leading to 55% of graduates receiving an offer before graduation for full-time positions (BLS), creating a gap in the ability to enter the tech workforce between degreed and non-degreed.

### üòû The Problem 
Minorities at large are underrepresented in tech, and this underrepresentation widens for non-degreed BIPOC. For first-generation students and minority students, finding good mentors is difficult because they may not have access to a professional network when connecting with the right person at the right time can significantly influence a person's career trajectory.

### üòä Our Solution
Mentee is a live-communication application that enables Mentees to find a community of mentors and other mentees in a similar trajectory and filter to find users with the same goals. Users log on to the application and are instantly greeted with a table populated with other users, they can filter through to find Mentees or Mentors. Mentors can  teach and lead, and mentees can learn, collaborate, and create a network of their choosing. Users can also utilize the inhouse technologies to video-call, text, and even screenshare, for the ease of communication.

### üßó‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Key Technical Challenge
Two technical problems are integrating multiple streams of communication within our app since voice audio, video chat, chat box, and screen sharing will need to overlap each other and deciding whether to build these features in-house or integrate a third party such as Microsoft Teams or Google Meet, depending on how complex each feature is to integrate.

### +++ Extension Opportunities 
Extension opportunities include building more customer-focused features for our application, such as setting up calendar networking events. It‚Äôs hard to build a calendar people want to use, especially in this day and age, where users probably have two or three calendars already in circulation. We can utilize the Google Calendar API to make events and store them in a massive user base without having to establish a calendar of our own.
